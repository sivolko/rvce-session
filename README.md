# Hands-on-Session

# What is SOC ?

SOC stands for Security Operation Center.

A SOC is a centralized function or team responsible for improving an organization’s cybersecurity posture and preventing, detecting, and responding to threats. The SOC team, which may be onsite or outsourced, monitors identities, endpoints, servers, databases, network applications, websites, and other systems to uncover potential cyberattacks in real time. It also does proactive security work by using the latest threat intelligence to stay current on threat groups and infrastructure and identify and address system or process vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. Most SOCs operate around the clock seven days a week, and large organizations that span multiple countries may also depend on a global security operations center (GSOC) to stay on top of worldwide security threats and coordinate detection and response among several local SOCs.

## Functions of a SOC :- 


SOC team members take on the following functions to help prevent, respond, and recover from attacks.

- **Asset and tool inventory**

To eliminate blind spots and gaps in coverage, the SOC needs visibility into the assets that it protects and insight into the tools it uses to defend the organization. This means accounting for all the databases, cloud services, identities, applications, and endpoints across on-premises and multiple clouds. The team also keeps track of all the security solutions used in the organization, such as firewalls, anti-malware, anti-ransomware, and monitoring software.

- **Reducing the attack surface**

A key responsibility of the SOC is reducing the organization’s attack surface. The SOC does this by maintaining an inventory of all workloads and assets, applying security patches to software and firewalls, identifying misconfigurations, and adding new assets as they come online. Team members are also responsible for researching emerging threats and analyzing exposure, which helps them stay ahead of the latest threats.

- **Continuous monitoring**

Using security analytics solutions like a security information enterprise management (SIEM) solution, a security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solution, or an extended detection and response (XDR) solution, SOC teams monitor the entire environment—on-premises, clouds, applications, networks, and devices—all day, every day, to uncover abnormalities or suspicious behavior. These tools gather telemetry, aggregate the data, and in some cases, automate incident response.

- **Threat intelligence**

The SOC also uses data analytics, external feeds, and product threat reports to gain insight into attacker behavior, infrastructure, and motives. This intelligence provides a big picture view of what’s happening across the internet and helps teams understand how groups operate. With this information, the SOC can quickly uncover threats and fortify the organization against emerging risks.

- **Threat detection**

SOC teams use the data generated by the SIEM and XDR solutions to identify threats. This starts by filtering out false positives from the real issues. Then they prioritize the threats by severity and potential impact to the business.

- **Log Management**

The SOC is also responsible for collecting, maintaining, and analyzing the log data produced by every endpoint, operating system, virtual machine, on-premises app, and network event. Analysis helps establish a baseline for normal activity and reveals anomalies that may indicate malware, ransomware, or viruses.

- **Incident response**

Once a cyberattack has been identified, the SOC quickly takes action to limit the damage to the organization with as little disruption to the business as possible. Steps might include shutting down or isolating affected endpoints and applicati

- **Recovery and remediation**

In the aftermath of an attack, the SOC is responsible for restoring the company to its original state. The team will wipe and reconnect disks, identities, email, and endpoints, restart applications, cut over to backup systems, and recover data.

- **Root cause investigation**

To prevent a similar attack from happening again, the SOC does a thorough investigation to identify vulnerabilities, poor security processes, and other learnings that contributed to the incident.

- **Security refinement**

The SOC uses any intelligence gathered during an incident to address vulnerabilities, improve processes and policies, and update the security roadmap.

- **Compliance management**

A critical part of the SOC’s responsibility is ensuring that applications, security tools, and processes comply with privacy regulations, such as the Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA). Teams regularly audit systems to ensure compliance and make sure that regulators, law enforcement, and customers are notified after a data breach.

## Key roles in a SOC

Depending on the size of the organization, a typical SOC includes the following roles:

**Director of Incidence Response**

This role, which is typically only seen in very large organizations, is responsible for coordinating detection, analysis, containment, and recovery during a security incident. They also manage communication with the appropriate stakeholders.

**SOC Manager**

Overseeing the SOC is the Manager, who typically reports to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Duties include supervising personnel, running operations, training new employees, and managing the finances.

**Security Engineers**

Security Engineers keep the organization’s security systems up and running. This includes designing the security architecture and researching, implementing, and maintaining security solutions.

**Security Analysts**

The first responders in a security incident, security analysts, identify threats, prioritize them, and then take action to contain the damage. During a cyberattack they may need to isolate the host, endpoint, or user that has been infected. In some organizations Security Analysts are tiered based on the severity of the threats they are responsible for addressing.

**Threat Hunters**

In some organizations, the most experienced Security Analysts are called Threat Hunters. These people identify and respond to advanced threats that are not picked up by automated tools. This is a proactive role designed to deepen the organization’s understanding of known threats and uncover unknown threats before an attack has taken place.

**Forensic Analysts**

Larger organizations may also hire Forensic Analysts, who gather intelligence after a breach to determine its root causes. They are looking for system vulnerabilities, violations of security policies, and cyberattack patterns that may be useful in preventing a similar compromise in the future.

## SOC Tools 

**Security information and event management (SIEM)**

One of the most important tools in a SOC is a cloud-based SIEM solution, which aggregates data from multiple security solutions and log files. Using threat intelligence and AI, these tools help SOCs detect evolving threats, expedite incident response, and stay ahead of attackers.

**Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)**

A SOAR automates recurring and predictable enrichment, response, and remediation tasks, freeing up time and resources for more in-depth investigation and hunting.

**Extended detection and response (XDR)**

XDR is a software as a service tool that offers holistic, optimized security by integrating security products and data into simplified solutions. Organizations use these solutions to proactively and efficiently address an evolving threat landscape and complex security challenges across a multicloud, hybrid environment. In contrast to systems like endpoint detection and response (EDR), XDR broadens the scope of security, integrating protection across a wider range of products, including an organization’s endpoints, servers, cloud applications, emails, and more. From there, XDR combines prevention, detection, investigation, and response to provide visibility, analytics, correlated incident alerts, and automated responses to improve data security and combat threats

**Firewall**

A firewall monitors traffic to and from the network, allowing or blocking traffic based on security rules defined by the SOC.

**Log management**

Often included as part of a SIEM, a log management solution logs all the alerts coming from every piece of software, hardware, and endpoint running in the organization. These logs provide information about network activity.

**Vulnerability management**

These tools scan the network to help identify any weaknesses that could be exploited by an attacker.

User and entity behavior analytics
Built into many modern security tools, user and entity behavior analytics uses AI to analyze data collected from various devices to establish a baseline of normal activity for every user and entity. When an event deviates from the baseline, it’s flagged for further analysis.

## SOC Realtion with SIEM 

Without a SIEM it would be extremely difficult for a SOC to achieve its mission. A modern SIEM offers:

- Log aggregation: A SIEM collects the log data and correlates alerts, which analysts use for threat detection and hunting.
- Context: Because a SIEM collects data across all the technology in the organization, it helps connect the dots between individual incidents to identify sophisticated attacks.
- Fewer alerts: By using analytics and AI to correlate alerts and identify the most serious events, a SIEM cuts down on the number of incidents people need to review and analyze.
- Automated response: Built-in rules allow SIEMs to identify probable threats and block them without the interaction of people.

It’s also important to note that a SIEM, alone, is not enough to protect an organization. People are needed to integrate the SIEM with other systems, define the parameters for rules-based detection, and evaluate alerts. This is why defining a SOC strategy and hiring the right staff is critical.
